# ðŸ§  TL;DR: Contributing Guide for Beginners

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

- Use the latest version before reporting.    ( *OF THE MAIN BRANCH ONLY ALWAYS?* )
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Format your `Code` & ```Codeblock``` properly ( *HOW TO MAKE THIS CLEARER?* )

## :repeat: Submitting Pull Requests

- Submit **small, focused** PRs.
- Don't refactor unrelated code.
- Discuss big changes first.
- If necessary update tests.    ( *WE WONT HAVE DOCS, CHANGELOG, ETC?* )
- PR into the appropriate branch (never `main`).    ( *IF IT'S A NEW FEATURE WE WANT TO PR INTO A NEW, NON-EXISTING BRANCH? WHO WILL CREATE IT?* )
- Fix any CI/test failures ASAP.    ( *MEANING CHECK BACK OR WAIT FOR THE AUTOMATED TESTS TO RUN AFTER PRing?* )

## :memo: Writing Commit Messages

- Subject line: 50 chars max, capitalized, no period, imperative: "Fix bug", not "Fixes bug" or "Fixed bug"
- Leave a blank line between subject and body.        ( *DOESNT THAT HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY?* )
- Explain **why** in the body, not just **what**.    ( *BODY REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, RARELY USED?* )

## :nail_care: Coding Style

- Follow the [official GDScript styleguide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
- Use spaces, not tabs.        ( *OTHER WAY AROUND, RIGHT?* )
